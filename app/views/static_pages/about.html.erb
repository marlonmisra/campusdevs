      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px">We are a group of students who are passionate about the power of programming and believe that all students can gain an advantage by learning to code. Our team is growing quickly and consists of undergraduates and graduates from many different faculties.</p>
      <h3>What do we do?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px">We provide students with access to space, peers, mentors and resources to help them succeed in learning to program. While much can be learned at university, our focus is to learn through collaboration, failure and feedback. While working hard is very important, it is simply not true that coding must be difficult.</p>
      <h3>Why should you join?</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px">Programming skills are becoming ever more important, quickly turning into the core competency for 21st century workers. By 2020, there will be 1,000,000 more jobs than students with the skills required to succeed in computer science. You should join because a technical background will prove to be extremely valuable for almost any career path that you choose.  </p>
